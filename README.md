### Exercise 1
Create a 5 page website with pages: Home, Page2, Page3, Page4, and Page5. The only thing that should be shown on the pages is the page name and the name of the page they came from. You must send a variable to the new page to show that.

### Exercise 2
Create a cocktail Model with name, alcohol percentage, and serving glass. Create a page that lists all cocktails in the database as links. The link should go to a different page with each cocktail's name on it that you clicked. The page should have a link at the top to go back to the home page.
